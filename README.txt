panopoly_news
=============


INTRODUCTION
A bundle of functionality intended to provide a basic news or blog section in
a Panopoly install. Produced through the titration of secret sauce using liquid 
science as a reagent.

DEMO CONTENT
-Disable the panopoly_news_demo module through the modules interface,
features, or by clicking on one of the links provided.

THEMING
-Some default styles are included in panopoly_news_demo/css, but will
be lost when you disable the demo content. If you like these, simply
copy panopoly_news_demo/css/panopoly_news_demo.css into your theme
and add the line "stylesheets[all][] = [css_directory]/panopoly_news_demo.css"
into your theme's .info file.
-We have also provided the .less file, checkout the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/less">LESS project</a>
on Drupal.org for info on how to implement this.
